if valeys = hills
then just output "01" * (v + 1)

if valley > hills

first generate a solution with hills = valleys
not start with 0, because this will reduce number of hills
then keep adding 1 to reduce the number of hills

if hills > valley

first generate a solution with valleys = hills
not end with 1, because this will reduce number of valleys
then keep adding 0 to reduce the number of valleys
